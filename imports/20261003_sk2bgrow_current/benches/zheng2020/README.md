# Zheng 2020 E. coli benchmark (P1 / M2 gate)

Head-to-head against [Pilea](https://github.com/xinehc/pilea) on real data with
an independent ground truth. This is the roadmap's decisive gate: if sk2bGrow
does not beat the Pilea baseline in the 1x band, the premise needs rethinking
rather than more engineering.

## Data

[Zheng et al. 2020, *Nature Microbiology*](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-020-0717-x),
"General quantitative relations linking cell growth and the cell cycle in
*Escherichia coli*" — BioProject **PRJNA615952**, 45 WGS runs of E. coli K-12
MG1655 across **16 growth media plus a stationary (RUN_OUT) control**, ~490x
each, most media in triplicate.

`fetch.sh` pulls only the first 600 000 reads per run (~19.4x) rather than the
full 55 GB, because everything is subsampled to <=10x anyway. SRA preserves
original flowcell read order, which is random with respect to genome position —
fine for a coverage profile, though not a substitute for true random sampling if
you care about tile-level bias. `fetch3.sh` retries from sibling replicates when
ENA throttles a particular path, which happens often and unpredictably.

## Ground truth

`growth_rates.tsv`, extracted from the paper's supplementary source data
(`41564_2020_717_MOESM3_ESM.xlsx`). Two different targets, and they are **not**
equally independent:

| target | what it is | independent? |
|---|---|---|
| `growth_rate` (lambda, /h) | steady-state growth rate, 0.40–1.72 across the 16 sequenced media | **yes** — measured by optical density / microscopy |
| `pred_log2ptr` = lambda*C/ln2 | theory-predicted log2(PTR) | **no** — the authors derived C from *this same sequencing* by marker-frequency analysis |

So correlation against `growth_rate` is the real test, and it is what Pilea's
reported r = 0.9764 refers to. RMSE against `pred_log2ptr` is a method
comparison against an independent analysis of the same reads — informative about
magnitude, but circular if quoted as accuracy.

The RUN_OUT control is a negative control: stationary phase, expected
log2(PTR) ~ 0.

## Arms

Five, so that the sketch and the estimator form a full 2 x 2 and each can be
attributed separately:

| arm | sketch | estimator |
|---|---|---|
| A | 16-enzyme anchors | adaptive windows + V-shape fit |
| E | FracMinHash (Pilea's) | adaptive windows + V-shape fit |
| B | 16-enzyme anchors | 25 kb windows + sorted/RANSAC (Pilea parity) |
| C relaxed | FracMinHash (Pilea) | Pilea, `-x 0 -z 0 -c 0` |
| C default | FracMinHash (Pilea) | Pilea, shipped defaults |

|  | V-shape fit | sorted/RANSAC |
|---|---|---|
| **anchors** | A | B |
| **FracMinHash** | E | C |

A vs C is the end-to-end number; the other three cells say where it comes from.
Three arms are not enough: with E missing, A vs B and B vs C give two *marginal*
effects that appear to attribute everything to the estimator, and the fourth cell
shows that reading was wrong (see below).

Arm E is built by `armE_counts.py`, which rewrites Pilea's sketch into our
count-table format -- one row per hashed locus with its genome coordinate -- and
then runs the **unmodified** sk2bGrow estimator on it.

Pilea is run twice because its default `--min-cove 5` refuses to report below
5x. Without the relaxed arm the low-coverage comparison degenerates into
"estimate vs no estimate", which is not a comparison. Both are reported; the
default arm is what a user actually gets.

## Running

```bash
./fetch.sh && ./fetch3.sh          # download (~2 GB, retries on throttling)
COVS="0.5 1 2 5 10" ./bench.sh     # arms A and B
./pilea_arm.sh                     # arm C (both gate settings)
./armE.sh                          # arm E (needs Pilea's interpreter)
python3 analyze.py                 # comparison table
```

Requires `pilea` on PATH (`conda create -n pilea -c bioconda pilea`) and a
release build of `sk2bgrow`.

## Reporting

Report two distinct counts: how many conditions yielded a finite estimate and
how many pass the tool's deployed QC. Also report Pearson/Spearman against
growth rate, RMSE against the predicted log2(PTR), and the fitted slope. A
tool that returns 16 numbers is not equivalent to one that returns 16 usable
numbers; conversely, filtering one tool by its default gates while showing the
other's failed rows is not a controlled comparison.

Record the sk2bGrow commit, the Pilea version, and the subsampling read counts
with any published number.

`analyze.py` writes both views to `results_qc.tsv`: all finite estimates and
default-QC-passed estimates. Set `SK2BGROW_COMMIT` and `PILEA_VERSION` when
running it.

## Current refresh (2026-09-30)

The current-implementation refresh is archived in
[`../refresh_20260930/`](../refresh_20260930/) and summarized for manuscript
use in [`../../docs/PAPER_RESULTS.md`](../../docs/PAPER_RESULTS.md). It uses
the 17 C1 conditions, three paired subsample seeds, depths 0.5–10×, and all
five arms; 1,275 output rows were completed.

Mean-across-seed, all-finite Pearson correlations for the principal arms are:

| coverage | A: anchors + V-fit | E: FracMinHash + V-fit |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 0.5× | 0.911 | 0.852 |
| 1× | 0.960 | 0.923 |
| 2× | 0.966 | 0.962 |
| 5× | 0.974 | 0.968 |
| 10× | 0.967 | 0.960 |

Mean default-QC passes are 0/16 A-arm media at 0.5× and 1×, 7/16 at 2×,
12.7/16 at 5×, and 14/16 at 10×. Thus the current refresh does not license a
deployable 0.5–1× claim. The historical section below is retained only for
provenance.

## Result (2026-08-24; QC re-read 2026-09-29)

Exact sk2bGrow commit at the original run was not embedded in `results_raw.tsv`.
Pilea v1.3.8 (bioconda).
16 media + stationary control, 600 000 reads/run subsampled to each level.
Full table in `RESULTS.txt`, per-run values in `results_raw.tsv`, and the
finite/QC split in `results_qc.tsv`.

### Correlation with measured growth rate

| coverage | sk2bGrow (all finite) | Pilea (defaults) | Pilea (gates off) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 0.5x | **0.913** | no estimate (n=0) | undefined — all 16 returned PTR=1.0 |
| 1x | **0.981** | no estimate (n=0) | 0.889 |
| 2x | **0.982** | no estimate (n=0) | 0.947 |
| 5x | **0.979** | no estimate (n=0) | 0.954 |
| 10x | 0.968 | 0.971 | 0.971 |

n = 16 finite estimates in every sk2bGrow cell. This is an **estimator view**,
not a deployed-QC view.

Pilea's published figure on this dataset is r = 0.9764 at full depth; it reaches
0.972 here at 10x, so the reimplementation-free comparison is consistent with its
paper.

**The estimator gate is passed; the deployability gate is not yet.** In the
all-finite view sk2bGrow is at or above Pilea gates-off at every coverage, and
the margin is in the 1–2x band. At Pilea's shipped defaults it returns no
estimate below 10x. But sk2bGrow's own default QC rejected every A-arm estimate
at 0.5–1x, and only 8/16 at 2x:

| coverage | A finite | A QC-passed | E finite | E QC-passed | Pilea default estimates |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 0.5x | 16 | 0 | 16 | 0 | 0 |
| 1x | 16 | 0 | 16 | 0 | 0 |
| 2x | 16 | 8 | 16 | 9 | 0 |
| 5x | 16 | 12 | 16 | 16 | 0 |
| 10x | 16 | 12 | 16 | 16 | 16 |

The correct claim is therefore: the coordinate-fit estimator has strong low-
coverage signal, but the current production QC is too conservative to call
0.5–1x estimates deployable. Do not compare the all-finite sk2bGrow column
against Pilea defaults as if both used the same reporting rule.

### What is actually responsible

Pearson r for all four cells of the 2 x 2, same reads throughout:

| coverage | anchors + V-fit | FracMinHash + V-fit | anchors + rank | FracMinHash + rank |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 0.5x | **0.913** | 0.724 | 0.164 | — (all 16 returned PTR = 1.0) |
| 1x | **0.981** | 0.940 | 0.683 | 0.889 |
| 2x | 0.982 | **0.984** | 0.756 | 0.947 |
| 5x | **0.979** | 0.977 | 0.914 | 0.954 |
| 10x | 0.968 | 0.942 | 0.913 | **0.971** |

**The two factors interact; neither is responsible on its own.** At 1x the
coordinate fit is worth **+0.30 r** on anchors but only **+0.05** on a
FracMinHash sketch (interaction +0.25), and the *sketch* effect changes sign with
the estimator: anchors are +0.04 ahead under the V-fit and −0.21 behind under
rank regression. The earlier three-arm reading of this table — "the gain is the
estimator, not the sketch" — was an artefact of the missing cell.

On magnitude the estimator dominates. RMSE at 1x is 0.157 (A) and 0.213 (E)
under the V-fit against 1.027 (B) and 0.397 (C) under rank regression; rank
regression on anchors is biased upward by +0.97 log2 units, which is defect D3
in its plainest form.

At 0.5x **only the combination survives** (r = 0.913): the V-fit on a
FracMinHash sketch falls to 0.724 and Pilea's own arm is degenerate. The
deterministic anchors are what keep windows populated at that depth; the
coordinate fit is what turns them into an unbiased slope.

### Negative control — RUN_OUT (stationary phase, true log2(PTR) ~ 0)

| arm | 0.5x | 1x | 2x | 5x | 10x |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| anchors + V-fit (sk2bGrow) | 0.260 | 0.077 | 0.097 | 0.060 | 0.046 |
| FracMinHash + V-fit | — | 0.010 | 0.034 | 0.008 | — |
| anchors + rank regression | 2.212 | 1.816 | 1.421 | 0.843 | 0.679 |
| Pilea (gates off) | 0.000 | 0.963 | 0.586 | 0.244 | 0.168 |
| Pilea (defaults) | — | — | — | — | 0.168 |

The sorted-regression estimator reports **log2(PTR) = 2.21 for a non-growing
culture** at 0.5x — it manufactures a gradient out of rank-ordered noise. This is
the clearest single demonstration of D3 in the whole benchmark, and it is why the
coordinate fit matters beyond its correlation score.

Both V-fit arms stay near zero where they report. Arm E declines to report at
0.5x and 10x, which is the estimator's QC firing on a single stationary sample
rather than a coverage effect; with one control sample per level there is no
basis for reading more into it than that.

### Caveats

1. **Pilea's "gates off" arm runs it outside its supported regime.** Its authors
   gate at 5x deliberately. The relaxed arm exists so the low-coverage
   comparison is not "estimate vs no estimate"; both columns are reported and
   the default column is what a user actually gets.
2. **Slope < 1 at low coverage** for sk2bGrow (0.62 at 0.5x, rising to 0.95 at
   10x). Conditions are ranked correctly but the PTR *range is compressed*.
   Correlation flatters this; RMSE against the predicted log2(PTR)
   (0.30 -> 0.04) shows it plainly. Do not quote r alone.
3. **RMSE is against a non-independent target.** See the ground-truth section.
4. **This is the easiest possible case**: one organism, one strain, a complete
   single-contig reference, no community. It says nothing yet about the
   metagenomic setting, which is where PTR estimation is actually hard.
5. Pilea's 0.5x row has no defined correlation because it returned the constant
   PTR = 1.0 for all 16 samples — a degenerate answer, not a missing one. It is
   reported as undefined rather than as a low correlation, and should not be
   read as "Pilea scored 0".
