# sk2bGrow — research plan for the HPC phase

For whoever runs the large-scale benchmarks next. Everything here was measured on
an M3 Max laptop against reduced datasets in `benches/`. Measured numbers are
given as measured; extrapolations are labelled as extrapolations. This file
supersedes the earlier `HPC.md` handover and absorbs it.

**Read Part 3 before Part 6.** Two claims in this project have already been
overturned by adding a missing control, and one documented mechanism turned out
to be simply wrong. The most useful thing you can do is keep breaking things that
way.

---

## Part 0 — Orientation

| where | what |
|---|---|
| `crates/sk2bgrow-core` | Rust: digest, anchor DB, counting, windows, origin search |
| `python/sk2bgrow` | Python: ZTP/ZTNB window rates, GC correction, V-fit, fusion, QC, report |
| `benches/zheng2020` | *E. coli* isolate benchmark, all arms, ground truth |
| `benches/fragmentation` | reference-fragmentation benchmark + the order-free prototype |
| `../sk2bGrow-paper/data/*.tsv` | every committed result table |
| `../sk2bGrow-paper/figures/` | `make_figures.py`, `make_tables.py` — pure functions of `data/` |

The integration contract is deliberately narrow: **the figure and table scripts
read only `data/*.tsv`, use no network, and regenerate everything**. Dropping
refreshed TSVs into `data/` with the same column names is the whole handoff. PDF
timestamps are pinned, so a regeneration with no change produces no git diff —
use that to check whether a figure really moved.

```bash
cargo test                                   # 86 tests, keep green
cargo build --release
COVS="0.5 1 2 5 10" ./benches/zheng2020/bench.sh
```

## Part 1 — The algorithm

### 1.1 What it estimates

Peak-to-trough ratio. During replication a growing cell has more copies of
sequence near the origin than near the terminus, so read coverage carries a
gradient whose amplitude is the growth rate:

```
log2(PTR) = C / tau = lambda * C / ln 2
```

where *C* is the replication period. Over a uniformly tiled chromosome, log2
coverage is a **tent function** of position — linear from ori down to ter with
equal |slope| on both replichores.

Two consequences are used repeatedly below, and it is worth stating them
explicitly because most of the design follows from them:

1. **The tent's amplitude is log2(PTR).** Fitting the tent in coordinate space is
   the direct estimator.
2. **The tent's *values* are uniformly distributed** on [log2 c_ter, log2 c_ori],
   with width log2(PTR). So PTR is also recoverable from the coverage
   *distribution alone*, with no coordinate. This is why Pilea's sorted-rank
   estimator is indifferent to reference fragmentation, and it is the basis of
   the prototype in `benches/fragmentation/spread_estimator.py`.

### 1.2 Why a deterministic sketch

sk2bGrow counts **Type IIB restriction-enzyme tags** (2bRAD anchors) rather than
a random hash subset. A 16-enzyme panel on *E. coli* yields 42,234 usable anchors
after masking multi-copy and shared sites — mean spacing 110 bp, median 59 bp.
Density varies ~20-fold across the panel (CjeI 1,962/Mb, PpiI 74/Mb).

The point is not that anchors are denser than a FracMinHash sketch. It is that
they are **at known coordinates and are the same in every sample and every
genome**, which buys three things a random sketch cannot: a coordinate for the
tent fit, sixteen *independent strata* for a consistency test, and shared tags
between genomes, which is what makes `sk2bgrow scaffold` possible.

### 1.3 The pipeline

**Stage 1 — index (offline, once).** Digest each reference with the panel; store
each tag with its coordinate, strand, local GC (±250 bp), and flags for
multi-copy / shared-across-genomes. Anchors are held in CSR arrays (sorted keys,
offsets, values) — see Part 3.3 A1.

**Stage 2 — count.** Scan reads for panel tags with pigeonhole seed indexing,
tolerating `--max-mismatch` (default 2). Scanning is **grouped by tag length, not
by enzyme**: two enzymes of the same tag length can satisfy their patterns on the
same physical read window, and the panel guarantees this happens because every
Bsp24I tag is byte-identical to a CjePI tag. One physical tag is one observation,
credited to each stratum the locus belongs to. Getting this wrong inflated
low-depth estimates by a large margin — see Part 3.2.

**Stage 3 — windows and rates.** Windows are cut inside each (genome, enzyme)
series in coordinate order, holding a fixed *number of anchors*, never straddling
a contig boundary. Size per enzyme is `clamp(n_anchors / 25, 25, 100)`, targeting
~25 windows. Counts within a window are fitted as a **zero-truncated Poisson
mixture** (EM, component count by BIC), with a **zero-truncated negative
binomial** branch selected by BIC when overdispersed. Truncation matters because
sequence divergence makes some reference anchors genuinely absent.

**Every window rate is returned with a standard error.** This is the single most
load-bearing output of the stage: it is what makes inverse-variance fusion
possible, and what lets the order-free estimator subtract noise instead of
reading it as growth.

**Stage 4 — GC correction.** A loess curve of log2 efficiency against GC fitted
**within each enzyme** and applied **at anchor resolution**, as an offset in log2
space. Each Type IIB site has its own base composition, so a single global curve
fits none of the sixteen. A constant per-enzyme efficiency cannot bias PTR (it is
absorbed by that enzyme's intercept); only GC *slope within* an enzyme matters.

**Stage 5 — origin and V-fit.** The origin is a property of the chromosome, so it
is estimated **once per genome from all enzymes pooled**, after median-centring
each enzyme. Then log2 coverage is regressed on circular distance *d* from the
origin,

```
log2 mu(x) = a - b1 * min(d, k) - b2 * max(0, d - k)
```

a piecewise-linear V on *real coordinates*, with an optional kink (segmented form
offered only with >=30 windows, selected by BIC). An externally supplied origin
(DoriC / Ori-Finder / *dnaA*) is used as a prior when given.

**Stage 6 — fusion and QC.** Each enzyme is an independent stratum. Estimates are
combined by inverse-variance weighting; **Cochran's Q** tests the null that all
enzymes measure one common value; on rejection the estimator escalates to
DerSimonian–Laird random effects. QC gates on coverage, detected fraction,
dispersion, containment, enzyme consistency, enzyme fit rate, and origin
confidence.

## Part 2 — Analysis method

### 2.1 The arms

sk2bGrow differs from Pilea in **two** places — what is counted, and how the
gradient is fitted. Comparing the two pipelines end-to-end cannot attribute the
difference, so the two factors are crossed:

| | coordinate V-fit | sorted-rank regression |
|---|---|---|
| **2bRAD anchors** | sk2bGrow (arm A) | arm B |
| **FracMinHash** | arm E | Pilea, gates off (arm C) |

Arm B runs our anchors through Pilea's windowing and estimator. Arm E rewrites
Pilea's own sketch into our count-table format so the **unmodified** estimator
runs on it (`benches/zheng2020/armE_counts.py`). Pilea is always reported in
**both** configurations — shipped defaults, and `-x 0 -z 0 -c 0` — because at its
defaults it returns nothing below 10×, and a benchmark of "estimate vs no
estimate" is not a comparison of accuracy, while reporting only the gates-off arm
is misleading in the other direction.

**Do not build arm E by feeding raw window rates into the V-fit.** That returns
log2PTR 2.65 against a measured 1.73, because what it removes is the surrounding
machinery, not the fitting geometry.

### 2.2 Metrics, and what each one misses

| metric | detects | misses |
|---|---|---|
| Pearson r | whether the ranking is recovered | a compressed or inflated scale — r is invariant to affine transformation |
| Spearman rho | monotone recovery, robust to outliers | magnitude, as above |
| RMSE | magnitude error in log2PTR units | direction |
| bias | systematic over/under-estimation | scatter |
| **slope** | dynamic-range compression | offset |
| recall | silence — a tool that reports nothing scores no error | whether what *was* reported is right |
| L2 (Pilea's metric) | — | **it rewards silence**: fewer terms, smaller norm |
| spurious | false positives | — |

Three rules, each of which this project learned the hard way:

1. **Recall and error must be read together.** A tool reporting 2 of 16 strains
   accurately scores better on L2 than one reporting all 16 with small errors.
   Report recall beside RMSE everywhere, and prefer per-genome RMSE to per-sample
   L2.
2. **Never quote r alone.** The fragmentation experiment is the extreme case:
   across 1 to 100 contigs r never leaves 0.86–0.97 while the slope falls from
   0.95 to 0.21. At 50 contigs r reads 0.96 and every estimate is 44% of truth.
3. **A constant output has no correlation.** At 0.5× Pilea's gates-off arm
   returns PTR = 1.0 for every sample; report r as *absent*, not zero, or it
   reads as "scored badly" instead of "produced no signal".

**Two different slopes appear in our outputs and they are not interchangeable.**
`table2` reports OLS of estimate on measured λ (0.615 at 0.5×, 0.951 at 10×);
the A4 analysis reports OLS of estimate on the λ·C-derived *predicted* log2PTR
(0.681 at 0.5×, 1.074 at 10×). Label which one you mean every time. RMSE and bias
are always against the predicted log2PTR; correlation always against λ.

**RMSE is against a non-independent target.** The predicted log2PTR comes from
the source paper's own marker-frequency analysis of the same reads. Say so
wherever it is quoted.

### 2.3 Cost

`/usr/bin/time -l` (macOS) or `-v` (Linux). On macOS `ru_maxrss` does propagate
from a grandchild, so the Python layer is included. Report wall time **per
depth**, never averaged: Pilea's cost is non-monotonic (5.6 s at 0.5×, **21.1 s
at 2×**, 5.6 s at 10×) because its ZTP-mixture EM is slowest where the mixture is
least identifiable — exactly the depth band this project is about.

---

## Part 3 — What is established

All on the Zheng *E. coli* dataset (16 media, λ = 0.40–1.72 h⁻¹, independent
ground truth) unless stated. n = 16 per cell.

### 3.1 Headline results

**Accuracy, complete reference** (Pearson r / RMSE vs predicted):

| depth | anchors + V-fit | FracMinHash + V-fit | anchors + rank | Pilea, gates off | Pilea, defaults |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.5× | **0.913** / 0.304 | 0.724 / 0.382 | 0.164 / 1.188 | degenerate | no estimate |
| 1× | **0.981** / 0.157 | 0.940 / 0.213 | 0.683 / 1.027 | 0.888 / 0.397 | no estimate |
| 2× | 0.982 / 0.128 | 0.984 / 0.093 | 0.756 / 0.667 | 0.947 / 0.259 | no estimate |
| 5× | 0.979 / **0.039** | 0.977 / 0.051 | 0.914 / 0.346 | 0.953 / 0.103 | no estimate |
| 10× | 0.968 / 0.063 | 0.942 / 0.149 | 0.913 / 0.230 | 0.971 / 0.077 | 0.971 / 0.077 |

**The gain is an interaction, not either factor alone.** At 1× the coordinate fit
is worth +0.30 r on anchors but only +0.05 on a FracMinHash sketch, and the
sketch effect *changes sign* with the estimator (+0.04 under the V-fit, −0.21
under rank regression). At 0.5× only the combination works.

**Which Pilea gate binds.** Re-applying each default threshold to gates-off
output (exact, no extra runs): `--min-cove` is responsible for **68 of 68**
suppressed *E. coli* estimates and **167 of 172** in simulation. A 150 bp read
gives 120 31-mers, so its k-mer threshold of 5 is ≈6.6× read coverage.

**Negative control** (stationary culture, truth ≈ 0):

| arm | 0.5× | 1× | 2× | 5× | 10× |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| sk2bGrow | 0.260 | 0.077 | 0.097 | 0.060 | 0.046 |
| anchors + rank | 2.212 | 1.816 | 1.421 | 0.843 | 0.679 |
| Pilea, gates off | 0.000 | 0.963 | 0.586 | 0.244 | 0.168 |

Sorted regression reports **log2PTR 2.21 for a culture that is not growing**. It
manufactures a gradient out of rank-ordered noise. This is the clearest single
demonstration in the benchmark of why coordinates matter.

**Multi-strain simulation** (16 genomes, 4/8/16 strains × 1/2/4/8×):

| | recall | RMSE | bias |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| sk2bGrow | **1.000** | **0.134** | **−0.013** |
| Pilea, gates off | 0.997 | 0.265 | +0.168 |
| Pilea, defaults | 0.224 | 0.083 | −0.045 |

Pilea's defaults have the best RMSE *because they report 22% of the genomes*.
This is metric rule 1 in one line.

**Fragmented references** (100 shuffled lognormal contigs; 43,707 of 43,735
anchors survive, so only the coordinate changes):

| depth | | complete | 100 contigs | scaffolded vs O157:H7 | Pilea on contigs |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1× | r | 0.981 | 0.550 | 0.977 | 0.827 |
| | slope | 0.779 | 0.103 | 0.755 | 0.628 |
| 10× | RMSE | 0.063 | 0.862 | 0.086 | 0.077 |
| | slope | 0.951 | 0.210 | 0.984 | 0.820 |
| | QC pass | 75% | **100%** | 88% | — |

- Fragmentation **removes the gradient** rather than adding scatter: every
  estimate lands at about a fifth of truth.
- `sk2bgrow scaffold` restores the complete-reference result **exactly, across
  strains** — contig order returns with Spearman 1.0000 against O157:H7,
  orientation 99/99 correct. The 712 kb raw placement error is a rigid rotation,
  invisible to a fit that searches for the origin.
- **On unscaffolded contigs Pilea wins outright** (r 0.827 vs 0.550 at 1×). Say
  so; it is a real architectural advantage of the sorted estimator.
- **The QC is anti-correlated with the failure**: 100% of fragmented estimates
  pass at 5–10× against 75% of correct ones. Cochran's Q asks whether the enzymes
  *agree*, and a destroyed coordinate makes all sixteen agree there is no
  gradient. Q cannot see a failure identical across strata.
- There is **no safe contig count**. Degradation is smooth and monotone from two
  contigs upward; even 5 contigs (N50 939 kb) costs 0.29 in bias.

**Panel size** (averaged over ≤2×):

| enzymes | anchors | r | RMSE | run-out bias | s/sample |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 2 | 17,055 | 0.951 | 0.188 | 0.073 | 3.2 |
| 4 | 24,753 | 0.959 | **0.165** | 0.074 | 4.4 |
| **8** | 37,232 | **0.969** | 0.171 | 0.123 | 6.5 |
| 16 | 43,735 | 0.959 | 0.196 | 0.145 | 8.2 |

**Cost**, seconds per sample, 85 *E. coli* cells. Reported per depth because
Pilea's is non-monotonic and a single averaged number hides that:

| depth | k=2 | k=8 | k=16 | Pilea, gates off | Pilea, defaults |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 0.5× | 2.2 | 3.8 | 4.3 | 5.6 | 0.9 |
| 1× | 3.1 | 5.9 | 6.8 | **16.8** | 1.0 |
| 2× | 3.4 | 6.8 | 8.3 | **21.0** | 1.0 |
| 5× | 3.6 | 7.5 | 9.8 | 8.6 | 1.1 |
| 10× | 4.0 | 8.4 | 11.9 | 5.6 | 5.5 |

sk2bGrow is monotone in depth and linear in panel size. Pilea's gates-off arm
peaks at 2× — the depth band this project is about — because its ZTP-mixture EM
is slowest where the mixture is least identifiable. Its default arm is cheap
below 10× only because it does no fitting there and returns nothing.
Peak RSS: 162 MB at k=2, 187 at k=8, 195 at k=16; Pilea 152–160 MB.

**Memory.** CSR index: 352 → **160 B/anchor** marginal at `--max-mismatch 2`,
count tables bit-identical, ~1% slower. GTDB species-rep projection 1.65 TB →
**752 GB** at 16 enzymes, ~672 GB at 8.

### 3.2 Claims that were tested and **refuted**

This section exists because it is the most useful part of the handover.

| claim | status |
|---|---|
| "The gain is the estimator; deterministic anchors are if anything behind" | **wrong** — an artefact of a missing 2×2 cell. The factors interact |
| "Pilea is ~7× faster" | **withdrawn** — at 1–2× it is 2.5× *slower* (16.8 s and 21.0 s against our 6.8 and 8.3); it is cheaper only at 0.5× and 10× |
| "Sparse enzymes are more biased, which explains the panel-size result" | **falsified** — −0.319 vs −0.312, no difference |
| "Fixed vs random effects explains the panel-size result" | **falsified** — RMSE 0.581 vs 0.506, wrong direction |
| "CSR will also be faster (cache-friendly, no pointer chase)" | **wrong** — ~1% slower; it buys memory only |
| "CSR will cost 12–16 B/anchor" | **wrong by an order of magnitude** — that costed only the steady-state arrays |
| "Low-coverage compression is errors-in-variables attenuation" | **wrong** — the predictor in that regression is effectively noise-free, and the slope exceeds 1 at depth, which no attenuation story predicts |
| "Origin misplacement explains the compression" | **mostly no** — a perfect origin recovers 0.06 of a 0.32 shortfall |

### 3.3 Open-issue status

| id | issue | status |
|---|---|---|
| A1 | index memory | **done** — 2.2×, 752 GB at GTDB scale. Remaining halvings: drop the build-time pair buffer (~58 B/anchor), mmap the AnchorDb (~38), ship 8 enzymes, shard by genome |
| A2 | fragmented references | **current grid complete; prototype QC** — `scaffold` writes an indexable single-contig FASTA and the 2026-09-30 R3 grid ran 324 cells. Complete/ordered controls are quiet; scrambled detection is 40/54 at log2PTR=1 and 40/54 at 1.5, and complete (72/72) at 5–10×. One scrambled stationary 1× cell fires, and 1× sensitivity is weak; do not wire WCG into production gates without more null data |
| A3 | attribution 2×2 | **done** — changed the claim |
| A4 | low-coverage compression | **current grid complete** — after fixed-origin signed slopes, recovered genome slopes are 0.774/0.958/1.012/0.995 for Poisson and 0.701/0.853/0.857/0.982 for NB at 0.5/1/2/5×. The b=0 floor is ≤0.10 in every arm/depth. Remaining NB compression at ≤1× accompanies upward bias in low-rate windows; report it as overdispersion/mis-specification plus residual noise, not the former ZTP all-ones bug |
| A5 | enzyme containment (Bsp24I ⊂ CjePI) | **measured, immaterial** — max 0.050 log2 change, Q rejection does not improve. Document; do not code |
| A6 | ship 8 enzymes not 16 | analysis done, **needs the panel sweep crossed with fragmentation** before the default changes. Recommendation stands: ship 8 |
| A7 | origin annotation | **tested** — ~10% RMSE at ≤1× (0.304→0.271, 0.157→0.143), nothing at ≥5×. Not the fix for A4 |
| A8 | strain mixtures | **out of scope by design** — two tents superposed are not identifiable from one sample. State as a limitation |

Also worth carrying: at 0.5× the mean per-enzyme V-fit has **r² = −0.009** —
individually worthless — while fusing sixteen of them correlates 0.913 with
measured growth rate. The panel, not any single fit, is what works there.

## Part 4 — Research objectives

Each objective states the question, why it matters, and **what result would
falsify the current position**. Answering "no" to any of these is a result.

### R1 — Does the 1–2× advantage survive real metagenomes?

Every real-data result so far is one strain against a complete reference. The
whole claim is usable estimates at 1–2× where Pilea's defaults report nothing.
**Falsified if** in a real community sk2bGrow's advantage at 1–2× disappears, or
its recall advantage is bought by spurious estimates on absent genomes.

### R2 — Where does scaffolding stop working?

`scaffold` was perfect against a different strain of the same species. Real MAGs
are incomplete and contaminated, and the nearest complete relative may be a
different genus. **The failure boundary is the number a MAG user actually needs**
and it cannot be guessed. Falsified if placement degrades already at the genus
level, in which case the marine and RBC datasets become limitations.

### R3 — Can the QC be made to see a destroyed coordinate?

Currently 100% of fragmented estimates pass. A contig-count guard firing at 2 is
the cheap fix, but it is a proxy: a *correctly ordered* multi-contig scaffold is
fine and would be flagged. Is there a statistic that separates "no gradient
because not growing" from "no gradient because the coordinate is scrambled"?
Candidate: within-contig slopes should have consistent |magnitude| under a real
gradient and be uncorrelated under a scrambled one.

### R4 — What compresses the slope at low coverage? — **answered**

**Not window shrinkage.** `benches/window_shrinkage.py`, known λ per window,
production estimator: at 5–10× the recovered log2 rate regresses on truth with
slope 0.98–1.01 and zero bias; at 0.5× the slope is **3.79** — the spread is
*inflated*, not compressed — with a level bias of −1.54 log2.

Decomposing the V-fit against a true log2(PTR) of 1.3, 12 seeds:

| depth | known ori | + trimming | + ori search | unweighted |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 0.5× | 0.80× | 0.71× | 0.72× | **2.82×** |
| 1× | 0.92× | 0.85× | 0.88× | 1.37× |
| 10× | 0.96× | 0.96× | 0.96× | 0.96× |

The **origin search is exonerated** (searching costs nothing against the true
origin). Tukey trimming costs ~0.09 at 0.5× and nothing from 5× up — real but
secondary. The rest is **inverse-variance weighting over-correcting a
heteroscedastic input**: `se` and `log2_rate` correlate at −0.94 at 0.5×, so the
ter-end windows that set the bottom of the V are exactly the down-weighted ones.
Dropping the weights overshoots to 2.82×. No reweighting repairs a biased input.

**It unifies R5**: handed the same inflated rates and large SEs, the width MLE's
deconvolution attributes all spread to noise and returns W = 0, while the V-fit's
weighting compresses. One input defect, two consumers, opposite symptoms.

**Diagnosis, then a demonstrated fix.** The ZTP inversion is exact
(`solve_ztp_lambda` recovers λ to 4 decimals from the exact mean of positives)
and the rate is unbiased on the *linear* scale at every λ ≥ 0.2. Model selection
is innocent: ZTNB is chosen ≤ 2% of the time at λ ≥ 0.41 and multi-component
never. Marginal CI coverage is 95% at every λ. What fails is the **log2
transform**: at λ = 0.41 the log-scale sd is 0.89 against a reported `log2_se` of
0.57, the tail is heavy to the left, and `se` correlates with `log2_rate` at
−0.82 *within one window's own sampling distribution* — so inverse-variance
weighting preferentially keeps the upward draws, and keeps more of them where λ
is lowest, which is the ter end.

Three repairs in log2 space were tried and all three fail: oracle weights from
the true λ overshoot to 2.94×, one-step IRLS to 2.04×, and a parametric bootstrap
returns se 1.93 against a true sd of 1.20 with a bias correction that overshoots
to −0.81 against a truth of −1.29.

**Fitting on the count scale works.** Treating the window totals as Poisson with
the tent as a log-link linear predictor — no per-window rate, no log2 transform,
no delta method, no realised-variance weighting — recovers:

| depth | current | Poisson GLM | GLM, no gradient |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 0.5× | 0.80× | **0.99×** | −0.101 |
| 1× | 0.92× | **1.04×** | 0.038 |
| 10× | 0.96× | **0.99×** | −0.001 |

0.95–1.02× across σ_eff 0, 0.3 and 0.6, negative control intact, and it also
sheds the residual 4% compression the current path never loses at depth.
`benches/window_shrinkage.py` stage 3. **Not yet ported to `fit.py`** — that
changes every number in the paper, so it is a decision, not a patch.

Caveat: the simulation is milder than the real grid (0.72× vs a measured slope of
0.615 at 0.5×) and the two are not the same statistic — a ratio at one PTR versus
a regression slope across sixteen media. Direction and depth profile match;
do not quote the magnitude as if it were measured.

### R5 — Does the order-free estimator become competitive with an overdispersion term?

`spread_estimator.py` recovers RMSE 0.87 → 0.14 at 5× on contigs and reports
0.000 on the stationary control where Pilea reports 1.153, but over-shrinks below
5× and has a ~0.4 floor at depth. Both failures point at the same missing term,
`s_eff² = s_w² + tau²`. **If that fixes both**, sk2bGrow gains a principled
fragmentation-proof mode and the two-estimator design of Part 3.1 becomes a real
feature rather than a workaround.

### R6 — Does the method scale, and at what panel size?

C6 below. Also the last blocker on shipping 8 enzymes by default.

### R7 — Do the conclusions hold against more tools?

Everything so far is sk2bGrow vs Pilea. Pilea's own paper compares CoPTR, GRiD,
iRep and DEMIC. **A two-tool comparison is not a benchmark**; add them.

## Part 5 — Data

Sizes are FASTQ bytes from the ENA file report, queried 2026-08-25.

Pilea's global-sludge survey (4,448 SRA sludge samples) is many TB — a separate
project, not part of this benchmark.

**Download procedure.** Write whole files, then subsample. `curl | gunzip | head`
races with SIGPIPE and silently truncates; a partially written FASTQ once made a
sample look too small and it was skipped at 10× without any error. Subsample only
after the download has finished, and verify the byte count against the ENA report
before using a file.

## Part 6 — Experiments

Compare against **Pilea v1.3.8 in both configurations** everywhere. Add CoPTR
v1.1.6, GRiD v1.3, iRep v1.1.14, DEMIC for R7.

### C1 — *E. coli* isolate accuracy at full depth (R1)
Repeat the laptop grid without the 600k-read cap: full ~490× per run, subsampled
to 0.25/0.5/1/2/5/10/20×. **Expect** the 1–2× advantage to hold and the 0.5×
point to firm up (n = 16 is thin there). **Failure**: if the advantage was an
artefact of taking the first 600k reads in flowcell order.

### C1b — cross-species (R1)
PRJNA1280254, four species at graded nutrient. **Expect** the *E. coli* result to
generalise. **Failure**: species-specific behaviour, which would mean the panel's
anchor density interacts with the estimate.

### C2 — fragmentation, generalised (R2)
`benches/fragmentation/run.sh` takes any genome. In priority order:
1. **Genuinely incomplete MAGs**, not just cut ones — drop random contigs and
   splice in foreign ones. `fragment.py` preserves every base; a real MAG does
   not.
2. **Progressively distant scaffolding references** — O157:H7, then *Shigella*,
   *Salmonella*, then a different genus. This is R2's boundary.
3. The 16-genome simulation grid under fragmentation.
4. The enzyme-panel sweep under fragmentation (last blocker on A6).

### C3 — multi-strain simulation at full scale (R1)
Pilea's grid: 120 genomes, up to 32 strains, up to 32×, 400 samples. The laptop
ran 16 genomes / 16 strains / 8× / 24 cells. **Expect** recall to stay at 1.00 and
RMSE to degrade gracefully with strain count. **Failure**: recall falling below
Pilea's gates-off arm at high strain counts.

### C4 — marine metagenome (R1, R2)
PRJNA551656 against the 101 MAGs, with Long et al.'s growth rates. Note Pilea
itself got estimates for only 18 of 101 — **report the same denominator**, or the
comparison is recall-vs-accuracy again.

### C5 — rotating biological contactor (R2)
PRJNA974210, 525 MAGs. This is the application section the paper does not have.

### C6 — GTDB-scale scalability (R6)
136,646 species reps against 100 Gbp. Budget **~750 GB at 16 enzymes, ~670 GB at
8, ~290 GB at 2** from the measured 160 B/anchor. Run at **8 enzymes** unless
there is a reason not to. Worth one 2-enzyme run for a like-for-like sketch-size
comparison: a 2-enzyme panel (17,055 anchors on *E. coli*) is almost exactly the
size of Pilea's FracMinHash sketch (18,261 k-mers).

### C7 — the A4 window-rate experiment (R4) — **DONE, do not re-run**
Run locally on 2026-09-05; `benches/window_shrinkage.py` reproduces it in a
minute. Result in R4 below. What remains from it is a *fix* in `ztp.py`, not
another experiment.

### C8 — Poisson GLM against the current fit, on the Zheng grid (R4, R5) — **new, do this before any re-run**

R4 showed the amplitude loss comes from the log2 transform, and that fitting the
window *counts* with a log-link tent recovers 0.95–1.02× at every depth in
simulation. C8 asks whether that holds on real data. **Everything in Part 9
waits on this**: if the GLM does not reproduce the simulated gain on the Zheng
grid, nothing else needs re-running.

**Implement first.** The GLM is not a drop-in; four pieces are missing.

1. **`window_rates` does not emit a count total.** It reports `rate`, `se`,
   `n_anchors`, `n_positive` — the sufficient statistic for a Poisson fit is the
   window's summed count, and it is discarded. Add `total_count` (additive; the
   `io` validator only checks for *missing* columns, so nothing breaks).
2. **`fit_glm` in `fit.py`**, exposed as `method="glm"` in `fit_windows`
   alongside `v_shape` and `sorted`. Keep the existing methods working — the A/B
   is the whole point, and a parallel method means every old number stays
   reproducible.
3. **Joint origin search under the Poisson likelihood.** The prototype used the
   *true* origin. R4 showed the search costs the V-fit nothing, but that is not
   evidence it costs the GLM nothing — profile the origin on the Poisson
   deviance and check against `ori_confidence`.
4. **GC correction becomes an offset.** Today GC enters by adjusting
   `log2_rate` (`log2_rate_raw`, `mean_gc_offset`, `gc_corrected`). In a GLM it
   belongs in the linear predictor as an offset, not as a pre-adjusted response.
   Also port the segmented/multi-fork branch, or record that `method="glm"`
   starts single-slope and say so in every result.

**Then measure.** Full Zheng grid, both methods, all five depths, per enzyme and
fused. Report side by side and never averaged across depths:

* r, RMSE and **slope** against measured growth rate, per depth;
* the stationary control — it must stay near zero (the V-fit reports 0.077 at
  1×; the simulated GLM gives −0.10 to +0.07);
* per-enzyme r², and how many accepted fits still sit below zero (15.9% today,
  57.5% at 0.5×);
* Cochran's Q, I² and the QC pass rate — these move with the per-enzyme
  estimates and are what Part 9 depends on;
* wall time and peak RSS. The GLM replaces a 180-point origin grid plus a
  weighted least-squares solve with a two-parameter optimisation; it may be
  cheaper, but that is a guess until measured.

**Falsified if** the GLM does not beat the V-fit's slope at 0.5–1× on real data,
or if it buys that slope by degrading the stationary control. Either outcome is
publishable: the simulation would then be missing something the real data has,
and finding out what it is *is* the result.

**Prototype and the numbers to beat:** `benches/window_shrinkage.py` stage 3.

## Part 7 — Reporting

Per experiment, send back: raw per-sample TSVs with **unchanged column names**,
the `/usr/bin/time` files, and tool versions. Dropping refreshed TSVs into
`sk2bGrow-paper/data/` regenerates every figure and table.

Report per depth, never averaged across depths. Report recall beside every error
metric. Report slope beside every correlation. Say which slope you mean.

**Flag anything that contradicts Part 3**, especially Part 3.2 — the refuted
claims are refuted on laptop-scale data and some of them could come back at
scale. If a result overturns something, that is the result; write it up as one.

---

## Part 8 — Traps already hit

- **`curl | gunzip | head` races with SIGPIPE** and silently truncates.
- **Subsample only after the download finishes.**
- **`pgrep -f script.sh` matches its own command line.** Wait on a log marker.
- **`%.6g` truncates genome coordinates** (3923883 → 3923880). Use `%.10g`.
- **A pandas column named `cov` shadows `DataFrame.cov()`.** Use `depth`.
- **Two enzymes of the same tag length can match the same read window.** Fixed;
  the regression test is
  `a_shared_locus_is_counted_once_per_enzyme_not_once_per_pass`. If you touch
  `count_read`, keep it green.
- **`profile --enzymes` was once parsed and discarded.** Excluded enzymes must be
  left out of the index, not emitted as zeros — zeros tell the statistics layer
  the enzyme was measured and found empty.
- **Pilea writes `output.tsv`, not `profile.tsv`**, and its log2(PTR) is already
  a column.
- **Pilea's cost is non-monotonic in depth.** Never average it.
- **matplotlib lacks a `→` glyph in Helvetica Neue.** Avoid arrows in figure text.
- **`savefig` with `bbox='tight'` widens the canvas to fit one long caption
  line.** Hard-wrap captions.
- **Contributors:** commits in these repositories must show `HuangShiLab` only.
  No `Co-Authored-By` trailers.

## Part 9 — What must be re-run if C8 adopts the GLM

Do not start any of this before C8 reports. If the GLM is not adopted, none of
it applies.

### Moves — every one of these uses a V-fit point estimate

| result | where | what changes |
|---|---|---|
| Zheng arms **A** and **E** | `benches/zheng2020` | r, RMSE, slope at all five depths |
| **A3, the 2×2** | `data/results_raw.tsv` | **two of the four cells.** Arms B (rank regression) and C (Pilea) do not use the V-fit and stay put — so the *interaction* that the paper's thesis rests on has to be re-derived, not merely re-tabulated |
| per-enzyme fits | `data/per_enzyme_zheng.tsv` | every column, including the r² < 0 rates |
| fusion and QC | `fusion.py` outputs | Q, I², τ², `consistent`, `consistency_checked`, and the QC pass rate |
| **A2 fragmentation** | `data/fragmentation.tsv` | slope 0.21 and bias −0.81 on contigs, and the finding that 100% of fragmented estimates pass QC against 75% of correct ones |
| contig sweep | `data/fragmentation_sweep.tsv` | the r-stays-high-while-slope-falls curve |
| panel sweep (A6) | `data/panel_sweep*.tsv` | the 8-vs-16 recommendation |
| spread estimator | `data/fragmentation_spread.tsv` | its baseline is the V-fit, and R5 predicts the GLM removes the W = 0 collapse too — check that directly |
| stationary controls | `RESULTS.txt` | all arms using the V-fit |
| C1, C1b, C2, C3, C4, C5 | HPC | every PTR number |
| figures and tables | `sk2bGrow-paper/figures` | fig 5, fig 8, tables 2/6/8 regenerate from the TSVs above |

### Does not move — do not spend time re-running these

| result | why |
|---|---|
| **σ_eff** (`HPC_TASKS_PAIRED_2BRAD.md` task 1) | per-anchor count ratios; no PTR machinery at all. **Safe to run now, and it should be** |
| A1, CSR index memory | Rust index layer, below the estimator |
| landmark density, GC tables | index-time properties |
| near-duplicate / mismatch rates (F3) | sequence properties |
| M4 containment screen correctness | genome selection, upstream of fitting |
| arm **B** (sorted-rank regression) | does not use the V-fit |
| arm **C** (Pilea, both gate settings) | their estimator, unchanged |
| Pilea's gate bracket, coverage ∈ (3.97, 7.50] | a property of Pilea |
| C5 recall = 522/522 | there is no coverage gate either way; the *QC pass* counts do move |

### Order

1. C8 implementation and A/B. Nothing else starts until it reports.
2. If adopted: Zheng grid first, because A3's interaction is what the
   Introduction claims. Re-derive it before rewriting anything.
3. Then fragmentation (A2 + sweep), because R5 predicts the W = 0 collapse
   disappears — that is a second, independent test of the same diagnosis.
4. Then the HPC experiments, then figures.
5. σ_eff runs in parallel throughout; it is unaffected.
